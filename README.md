### Hello there 👋

You can call me Jace, I am a junior web-developer and -copywriter, scripting away since 2018.

- Pronouns: they/them
- Age: ⚪🥈🐉
- Loc: Somewhere in the BeNeLux 🌍

### Let's talk coding-scripting 👀

Currently I have knowledge of a couple languages
| Basic Web-languages | Extensions & Libraries | Other |
|---|---|---|
| HTML _(2018)_ | jQuery _(2019)_ | Bash _(2022)_ |
| CSS _(2018)_ | SASS _(2022)_ | Markdown _(2022)_ |
| JS _(2018)_ | TS _(2022)_ | 
| PHP _(2019)_ |
| SQL _(2019)_ | 

I primarily work with the basic web-languages but since not too long I discovered the power of supersets like SASS and TS for CSS and JS respectively to help with the workflow. I use bash-scripts to simplify my Git and NodeJS setup.
