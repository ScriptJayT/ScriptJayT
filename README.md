## Hello there 👋

My name is Jace, nice to meet you.

They/them, thnx 🌈

## Things about me

I have been crawling this mighty green blob 🌍 since the year 2000. (numeric pleasing year, isn't it?) and it is only after 18 years that I found the side of this web thingy 🕸 where one can build interactive stuff. Pretty stuff. Functional stuff. Stuff that encapsulates all three and more.

So I have been learning how to build stuff.<br>
And that even resulted in me getting a job as web developer, after some searching.

## Languages I speak
Some are basic, some are great, some I don't realy like (Yes, Jquery, I'm looking at you). But here a short list of the ones I use pretty much daily.

<a href="https://www.w3.org/html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" alt="html5" width="40" height="40"/> </a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original-wordmark.svg" alt="css3" width="40" height="40"/> </a>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 
(Basic, but still great)

<a href="https://www.php.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/php/php-original.svg" alt="php" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 
<a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/mysql/mysql-original-wordmark.svg" alt="mysql" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 
(Getting old, but stil gold)

<a href="https://sass-lang.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/sass/sass-original.svg" alt="sass" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg" alt="typescript" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 
(Yes, more of this!)

<a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original-wordmark.svg" alt="nodejs" width="40" height="40"/> </a> (I need this for the previous two, but BUN, when are you ready??)

<a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/git-scm/git-scm-icon.svg" alt="git" width="40" height="40"/> </a> (Obviously)

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/gnu_bash/gnu_bash-icon.svg" alt="bash" width="40" height="40"/> </a> (And this, because I'm too lazy to remember the steps to setup the previous two 😉)


At this time, I'm interested in learning how to build mobile and desktop applications, and I am planning to test Tauri and Electron. <br> The latter with which I am building a full-spec todo-app for my own use.
On that same project-plank is the task of building a CMS of my own. 🌪

I don't really use frameworks at the moment but I have seen some like Astro and Svelte which peeked my interest, however Vite will probably be the first to check out.

## Languages I actually speak

I can speak a few: Dutch and English; <br>
I can undestand a few: French and German; <br>
and I can dabble in a few: Japanese.

⚡Fun fact: Recently I started writing some articles about scripting. Nothing too grand. Just fun for me to write and -I hope- for you to read. I post them (on a irregular base) on <a href="https://dev.to/scriptjayt" target="_blank">dev.to</a>, if you're interested.

## My Work Environment 💻

I use VS Code as my IDE with the following extensions installed:
- Live Server
- Prettier
- Indent-Rainbow
- Better Comments
- Codesnap
- PHP Intellephense
- Auto Rename Tag

And these are the browsers I personally use for testing
- Chrome _(Desktop & Mobile)_
- Brave _(Desktop)_
- Firefox _(Desktop)_
- Duckduckgo _(Mobile)_
