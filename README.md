# Welcome

Did you wander here? Or where you brought by the algorythm?

I myself tripped over my feet and dove head first in this old, wet cave where the columns of basalt curve up like ribs in there cage and the sweet scent of moss lingers.
<br>It's been a while since then, and I find myself more and more intrigued with the cluster of webs I found sticking against the cave walls like old drapy curtains. Each with their own silk wires that are weaved together unlike any other.

Would you care to stick around for a bit? See if you find anything of interest to you. You never know what sight might spark your inspiration.

Like this coccoon of PHP, TS and SASS that's supposed to pop soon into a primitive but functional CMS. 
 
Perhaps you are more about mythical plans; like the one about a site of my own, hidden in the depts of this cave. <br>It's a beautiful plan, a simple gray folder with a cover illustrated with golden letters. _'To be build Vite,'_ does it say.
<br>Or the plans for a text-editor that seem to Rust away at the bottom of the river around the corner. Guarded by the wits and tridents of young merfolk, who sing there stories to anyone that cares to listen.

No? A shame. Perhaps the wind may entertain you, with some wispers in your ears of technical but relaxed writing.
<br> But no matter. Take your time. Look around. Feast your eyes and ears. Fullfil your curiousity; as there is no better way to be than curious.

Going already? Well then, 
<br>I hope to see you around again some day.
