### Hello there 👋

You can call me Jace, I am a junior web-developer and -copywriter, scripting away since 2018.

- Pronouns: they/them
- Age: ⚪🥈🐉
- Loc: Somewhere in the BeNeLux 🌍

### Let's talk coding-scripting 👀

Currently I have knowledge of a couple languages
| Basic Web-languages | Extensions & Libraries | Other |
|---|---|---|
| HTML _(2018)_ | jQuery _(2019)_ | Bash _(2022)_ |
| CSS _(2018)_ | SASS _(2022)_ | Markdown _(2022)_ |
| JS _(2018)_ | TS _(2022)_ | 
| PHP _(2019)_ |
| SQL _(2019)_ | 

I primarily work with the basic web-languages but since not too long I discovered the power of supersets like SASS and TS for CSS and JS respectively to help with workflow. Furthermore I use bash-scripts to simplify my Git and NodeJS setup.

### My Work Environment 💻

I use VS Code as my IDE, and thusfar pretty much al I need.
With following extensions installed:
- Live Server
- Prettier
- Indent-Rainbow
- Better Comments
- Codesnap
- PHP Intellephense
- Auto Rename Tag

And these are the browsers I use for testing
- Chrome _(Desktop & Mobile)_
- Brave _(Desktop)_
- Firefox _(Desktop)_
- Duckduckgo _(Mobile)_
