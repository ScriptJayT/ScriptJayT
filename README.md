### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jace, a junior web-developer and copywriter.
I have been scripting since 2018 and writing for the web since 2022

- Pronouns: they/them

Currently I code in a couple of web-languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- PHP
- SQL

But sometimes I do play with some other languages, though not as many
- Bash
